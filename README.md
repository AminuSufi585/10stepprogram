# A 10 Step Program For Great Tech Talks

## Summary

"How was the presentation?"
"It was ... um, OK. Kind of interesting."

Don't let the above be your talk!  There's a lot more to doing a
good talk than just knowing the code you're presenting.  Join this
tutorial to learn the ten steps to transform "um, OK" to "great!"

## Description

You know the code and the project.  You're doing lots of cool stuff.
You have plenty of slides.  So why is the audience all doing their email?

It doesn't have to be that way! Great presenters are made, not born.
The way to become a better speaker is through training, science, and practice.
In this audience-participation tutorial, veteran conference presenters
Vicki Brasseur and Josh Berkus will tech you the ten steps to great tech talks:

1. Know Your Audience
2. Have an Idea
3. Tell a Story
4. Craft Your Presentation
5. Practice Your Talk
6. Get Ready to Speak
7. Present Yourself
8. Deal with Demo Failure
9. Interact with the Audience
10. Continue the Conversation

If you have never attended a speaker training before, this tutorial will
show you how much better your talks could be.  If you have, 
you might pick up a few tips and ideas.  And if you're presenting at SCALE,
this tutorial will give you some last-minute changes to tweak your
talk.
