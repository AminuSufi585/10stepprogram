EXERCISE: Q&A Werewolf
======================

This is a game for between 6 and 20 players, designed to teach techniques of handling 
problematic people during Q&A sessions.

Cards
-----

* 1 Speaker Card
* 5 Problem People cards with names
* 14 Alex Audience cards, numbered 1 to 14

Setup
-----

First, sort the deck and remove cards until it matches the number of players:

* 6 or 7 players: 1 Speaker, 2 Problems, and 3-4 Audience
* 8 or 9 players: 1 Speaker, 3 Problems, and 4-5 Audience
* 10 to 13 players: 1 Speaker, 4 Problems, and 5-8 Audience
* 14 to 20 players: 1 Speaker, 5 Problems, and 8-14 Audience

The 5 Problem People cards are the ones which do not say "Speaker" or "Alex Audience".
Mix them and randomly pick out the requisite number. 

Sort the Alex Audience cards in order of their number, and pick he required number
off the top.  For example, if you need 7 Audience, pick Alex Audience 1 to 7.  Add
these to the Problem People stack.

The first round, add the Speaker card to this stack.

One player is to shuffle these cards and deals them face down to all of 
the other players. The player with the Speaker card reveals it.  All
other players conceal their cards.

One player should also volunteer to run a timer.

Game Play
--------

The game is organized into multiple turns. Each turn, a different player is the Speaker.
The Speaker is attempting to defeat attempts to derail his/her Q&A session by 
various Problem People. The Problem People are trying to make the speaker look
bad and the other audience members leave.

Each turn begins with the Speaker giving a 30-second talk on some topic. This topic can
be chosen by the Speaker based on a talk they gave/are giving at some conference.
Alternately, the Speaker can choose from the Topic Deck:

* Shuffle the Topic Cards.
* Choose two cards from the deck.
* Pick one of those to speak about.
* At the end of your turn, put the two cards back.

After the micro-talk, the Q&A session begins with the Speaker asking "are there 
any questions?"  At this point, the timer should start.

The other players raise their hands to ask questions.  The speaker will choose them
one at a time to ask. The Problem People will attempt to disrupt the Q&A session, 
without specifically revealing who they are. The Alex Audience members will ask
normal, sincere questions and will not be disruptive.

All players, especially Correct Casey, are encouraged to use the internet
to find appropriate questions to ask.

Each time a Problem Person speaks is a "confrontation". The Problem Person "wins" the
Confrontation if the Speaker becomes flustered, embarassed, gets drawn into and extented
argument, blows up, or is otherwise unable to continue with the Q&A session. The Speaker "wins" if
they can Shut Down the Problem Person and continue with Q&A promptly.

Every time a Problem Person "wins" a Confrontation, one Alex Audience member will turn in
their card and stop asking questions, in the numerical order of the Alex Audience
cards. If a Problem Person gets Shut Down so effectively the player can't 
figure out a way to return to Speaker harassment, they will turn in their cards
and stop speaking.

Audience Members who have had a Question Answered intelligently by the Speaker
will not turn in their cards.  Instead, the next Audience member will do so.

If the Speaker attempts to Shut Down an Alex Audience member by mistake, that 
Audience turns in his/her card, as does one other Audience member.

The turn ends under one of three conditions:

* If there are no more Alex Audience members, the Speaker loses.
* If all of the Problem People have been shut down, the Speaker and Audience wins.
* If all of the Audience members have had Questions Answered, the Speaker wins.
* The timer runs out. If there are more Audience members remaining than Problems,
  the Speaker wins.  Otherwise, the Problem People win.

Next Speaker
------------

At the end of the round, the most successful Problem Person becomes the next Speaker,
unless they have been the Speaker already this game, in which case the second most 
successful Problem Person becomes the speaker.

All of the Alex Audience members from the round choose the most Problematic Person by voting with
their fingers: at the count of three, everyone points.  If the result is unclear,
the Problem Person with the lowest numbered card becomes the next Speaker.

Notes on Problem People
-----------------------

The Problem People are trying to disrupt the speaker without appearing to
do so deliberately. While they will be disruptive and rude, they will not
use profanity, yelling or personal attacks because that would be a giveaway.
As much as possible, they want to appear to be Alex Audience members until
they can deliver their attacks. 

The Problem players should, as much as possible, "play" their roles and
behave the way a real audience member of their type would.

Interrupting Iggy: will interrupt anyone at an time. Will also try to answer
other askers for the speaker, not allowing the speaker to speak.  Iggy wins
each time s/he can interrupt someone or answer for the speaker without
an appropriate response from the speaker.

One-Note Ollie: will ask her/his "one question" after waiting.  After that,
will interrupt other askers to ask that question again.  Ideally, this
question should be controversial, extreme, and/or preposterously technical.
Ollie wins the second and each succeeding time they are able to ask their question.

Reminiscing Randy: his/her goal is to talk as long as possible before being
stopped.  Randy's reminiscing does not have to have anything to do with the
Speaker's topic. Randy "wins" if s/he can continue rambling on for 20 seconds,
and wins again for every additional 10 seconds they keep talking.  Once
Shut Down, Randy will quit.

Correct Casey: note that Casey's corrections do not actually have to be correct.
Instead, Casey wins every time they can correct the speaker and either 
provoke a bad response, or embroil the Speaker in an argument which lasts
more than a few seconds.

Shutting Down Problem People
----------------------------

When the Problem People speak, it is the goal of the Speaker to Shut Down their
attack. This consists of cutting off the Problem Person politely but firmly, 
nd finding some way to make them unable to continue with their attack
without becoming clearly unreasonable or deranged. 

For example, a firm "That's an interesting topic but it's very involved. How
about we talk about it in the hallway afterwards?" delivered to One-Note Ollie
in the middle of a question repeat will Shut Down.
