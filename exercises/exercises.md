Exercise Setup
==============

There will be three groups of exercises.

Exercises I
-----------

This batch of exercises includes:

1. writing a topic sentence
2. adapting content to audiences
3. picking a story type

Audience members will divide up according
to the number on each of their placecards,
which should split them into groups of 
5 to 6 each.  If anyone is in a group of 
only one or two, they should merge with a
larger group.

The presenters will call time on each of the
exercises.

As not all participants will get to do all
exercises, please make sure that each participant
gets to do at least one exercise by taking turns
round-robin.

Exercises II
------------

This batch of exercises consists of the
Present Yourself exercises, including:

1. Stance
2. Floating
3. Diction/Tongue Twisters

Audience members will divide up according
to the number on each of their placecards,
which should split them into groups of 
5 or 6 each. If anyone is in a group of 
only one or two, they should merge with a
larger group.

As not all participants will get to do all
exercises, please make sure that each participant
gets to do at least one exercise by taking turns
round-robin.

The presenters will call time on each of the
exercises.

Exercises III
-------------

This is only the Q&A Exercise.

Audience members will divide up according to their
usual group numbers.  However, the groups should
merge in pairs, that is Group 1 should merge with 
Group 2, and Group 3 with Group 4, etc.  This should
yield groups of 10 to 12 each.

They will then play the Q&A "game" until the end
of the exercise.
