EXERCISE: Stance
=====

This exercise teaches how stance affects talk delivery.

Time
----

This exercise will take ___ minutes.

Setup
-----

Get out the sample texts.

Speak
-----

One participant will volunteer to go first, preferably one
who hasn't spoken in an exercise before.

The speaker will take the top text from the sample texts.
They will then adopt a "closed" stance:

* Facing 1/4 turn away from the audience
* Shoulders hunched forwards
* Feet together
* Head down over the text

The speaker will then read the sample text aloud.
They will then adopt an "open" stance:

* Facing the audience squarely
* Shoulders back and chest expanded
* Feet shoulder width apart
* Head back and chin up

They will read the sample text again.

Participants are encouraged to comment on the difference between
the two readings.

The next speaker will then take another text, until
time is called on the exercise.
