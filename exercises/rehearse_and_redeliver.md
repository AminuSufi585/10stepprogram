EXERCISE: Rehearse and Redeliver
================================

For this exercise, participants do "homework" and rehearse their talks
before the 2nd half of the training.

Time
----

This exercise will take 15 minutes in each of half session.  It will also
take overnight for rehearsal.

Exercise
--------

Four chosen participants will take a micro-talk they have either prepared,
or already delivered in the other exercises.  In the time between sessions,
they will revise this micro-talk according to the first five lessons.

They will then rehearse the micro-talk during the intervening day, with
a minimum of three complete deliveries.

At the beginning of the next session, they will deliver their micro-talks
again.  After delivery, they will explain how they rehearsed the talk,
and the group will discuss where it has improved and where it hasn't.
