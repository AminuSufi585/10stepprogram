EXERCISE: Picking a story type
=====

In this exercise, participants will each attempt to pick a "story type"
for one or more talks.

Time
----

This exercise should take 5 minutes.

Setup
-----

Shuffle the topic cards.

Each participant should do one of two things:

1. Pick a topic which they will soon speak about at a conference, or:
2. Pull two cards from the Topic deck and choose one.

Exercise
--------

One participant volunteers to speak first. They will announce their chosen topic,
and the story type they have chosen out of the 7 basic story types:

* catalog 
* end-to-end
* enlightenment
* quest
* theme & variations
* show & tell
* post-mortem

They then will deliver a 30 to 45 second micro-talk on their topic using this
story type. Afterwords, the other participants will briefly discuss how well
the topic and story type matched.

Participants then proceed to the next speaker, who repeats the exercise until
time runs out.
