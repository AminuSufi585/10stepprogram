EXERCISE: Floating
======

This exercise teaches use of eye contact.

Time
----

The exercise will take 5 minutes.

Setup
-----

Each participant will pick a topic, either:

* Some topic they have presented on several times before, or
* Some topic which they are very familiar and comfortable with, or
* Draw cards from the Topic Deck until they find one they have
  a lot to say about.

The idea is to find a topic which each person can speak on without
much thought so that they can focus on eye contact.

Speak
-----

Taking turns, each speaker will deliver a 30 to 45 second micro-talk
on their chosen topic. During this talk, they will "float" their eyes:

1. they will make eye contact with each member of the "audience"
   one at a time
2. eye contact will last no more than 1-2 seconds each.

When they are done speaking, the other participants will discuss the
speaker's eye contact and how it made them feel about the talk, 
briefly.

After this, the next participant will speak.
