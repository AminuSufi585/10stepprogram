EXERCISE 1: Adapting Presentation Content to Your Audience
=======

In this exercise, participants will be trying to re-interpret content for different 
audiences. 

Time
----

This exercise should take 10 minutes.  Not all participants will have time
to speak, but all should be able to participate in the discussion.

Setup
----

Shuffle the topic cards and the audience cards in two seperate stacks.
Each participant pulls two of each card.

Alternately, speakers can use a talk they have already prepared.

Participants will look at the two topic cards they have been given,
and pick one of the two as their topic to speak on.  They will then
return the unused topic to the deck.  Participants will not show
each other their cards.

Speak
-----

One particpant will volunteer to go first. S/he will pick one of the 
two audience cards as his/her audience. The speaker will then deliver
a 30 to 45 second micro-talk on the topic, as if addressing that 
audience.

When they are done speaking, the other participants will make comments
and ask questions for 1 or 2 minutes about why the speaker made the 
choices they did in how to present the topic.

A second participant will then volunteer to speak.
They will deliver their on micro-talk, aimed at the audience
on one of their two audience cards. This time, they will 
_not_ announce who the audience is.

When they are done speaking, the other paricipants in the group 
will try to guess things about the audience based on the speaker's
presentation. After some of these guesses, the speaker will reveal
who the audience was supposed to be.

If time allows, a third participant will repeat the exercise without
announcing the target audience.
