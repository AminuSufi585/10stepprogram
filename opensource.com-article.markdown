**Mission:** Write an article for opensource.com on the topic of "10 tips to improve your conference". Due before **2015-12-28**. Length: beginning to end.

Some ideas for the 10 tips:

1. Fix your damn badges (<-- VMB has a forthcoming blog post on this subject)
1. Clear communication
  * Where, when, how to get there
  * Plans for each day
  * Where to ask questions
  * Answer those questions promptly, no matter how they got to you
  * let speakers know whom to contact about a problem (speaker coordinator)
  * Provided A/V, connectors
  * Whether it'll be recorded and, if so, when/where it may be available & what the speakers' reposting rights are
1. Conference app
  * Usable
  * Up to date (schedule)
  * Not burdened with ads
1. Schedule up to date
  * If many, let people know which one is canonical
  * Post the schedule for the day at each room

  * Have the known social events on the official schedule along w/the other sessions
1. Make sure the content suits the expected audience
  * Provide guidance to speakers in advance
  * Expected audience profile
  * Expected audience size
  * marketing vs. technical
1. Provide a talk feedback/rating mechanism
    * plug it in keynotes
    * have it clearly linked on the website
    * tell speakers/room monitors about it and to plug it
    * ratings site/app should work under poor wifi conditions
    * should be just a star rating plus comments (comments required)
    * speakers should get to see anonymous feedback
1. Don't require slides in advance (I mean, really, WTF; I ignore this crap)
1. Provide a more accessible environment
  * Walk/roll lanes
  * Ample & free water/coffee/tea
  * For food/bev, provide vegan options on par with omnivore, non-alcoholic options on par with alcoholic
  * Have social/evening events which don't require/involve drinking
  * If there are networking events, make sure they're not so loud people can't network without shouting
1. Provide job boards and/or a job fair (BoF)
  * also, BOF space/meeting board for other groups (board, wiki)
  * make the conference a good meeting space for groups
1. Provide a chat/communication mechanism (hashtag, IRC, Slack, etc.)
  * Communicate this to all attendees so they can coordinate their own meetups
1. Daily morning "Here's what's happening today" mailings
1. Wifi is a bitch
  * hard to make work
  * do not require it for attending the conference
  * keep trying to make it work
