**Mission:** Write an article for opensource.com on the topic of "10 tips to improve your conference". Due before **2015-12-28**. Length: beginning to end.

Some ideas for the 10 tips:

1. Have a code of conduct (and train staff on what that means)
1. Fix your damn badges (<-- VMB has a forthcoming blog post on this subject)
1. Clear communication
  * Where, when, how to get there
  * Plans for each day
  * Where to ask questions
  * Answer those questions promptly, no matter how they got to you
1. Conference app
  * Usable
  * Up to date (schedule)
  * Not burdened with ads
1. Schedule up to date
  * If many, let people know which one is canonical
1. Post the schedule for the day at each room
1. Post full day's schedule in a high-traffic area
1. Have the known social events on the official schedule along w/the other sessions
1. Make sure the content suits the expected audience
1. Provide guidance to speakers in advance
  * Expected audience profile
  * Expected audience size
  * Provided A/V, connectors
  * Whether it'll be recorded and, if so, when/where it may be available & what the speakers' reposting rights are
1. Provide a talk feedback/rating mechanism
1. Don't require slides in advance (I mean, really, WTF; I ignore this crap)
1. Provide a more accessible environment
  * Walk/roll lanes
1. Provide job boards and/or a job fair (BoF)
1. Provide a chat/communication mechanism (hashtag, IRC, Slack, etc.)
  * Communicate this to all attendees so they can coordinate their own meetups
1. Daily morning "Here's what's happening today" mailings
1. Ample & free water/coffee/tea
1. For food/bev, provide vegan options on par with omnivore, non-alcoholic options on par with alcoholic
1. Have social/evening events which don't require/involve drinking
1. If there are networking events, make sure they're not so loud people can't network without shouting
