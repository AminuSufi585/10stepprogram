# Post-Mortem

## SCaLE 14x

* Post-Q&A exercise feedback
  * Positive
    * Appreciated that they were split into small groups so they weren't put on spot in front of everyone
  * Negative
    * In the talk description, should not there will be participatory group exercises that involve speaking
* During lunch feedback
  * The topic cards were all fairly technical in nature & someone who was not technical said she did not feel like she belonged there because of that
    * There were less technical topic cards, but due to snafus during printing, they didn't, uh, print.
    * We're going to try to replace as many cards as possible with entirely non-technical things as possible ("how to boil water," "how to tell what side of your car the gas tube is", etc.)
* [Evaluation form feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBwRt5GnlMxNEFDwqDOaCop2Be57RriSwRognbJ-qYk/edit#gid=940560440) (so far)
  * "The organization of topics was really great and each topic was covered at a useful level of detail. Thanks!"
  * "Great tone, really useful tips, I'd iterate further on the exercises. They were useful but felt a little rough on execution."
  * "Good content, I felt that the presentation was well worth my time. However, instructions for some of the group exercises were a little unclear."
  
### Plans:

* Speaker notes need to be finished
* Explain exercise rules before we split people up (they'll be less distracted & more likely to get the rules in their brains)
* There are too many exercises for the time allotted
  * May be able to do 2 in each Exercise section, with the optional Q&A game
  * We'll have to think about which 4 exercises to do
    * Audience exercise seems difficult for people to grok
    * Topic sentence is almost something people need to sit & write down
      * We'd rather scrap it, really
  * Distill rules to ordered list on a slide
    * Can have on the screen while explaining it
    * Also: less printing
* VMB wants to add more graphics to her slides
* Follow-up on the survey
  * Are demos rated low for talk contribution because they suck or that they're good but don't contribute to the talk?
  * Other things which escape us right now
