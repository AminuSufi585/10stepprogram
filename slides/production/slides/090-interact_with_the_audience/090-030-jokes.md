Jokes can be a very effective way to connect with your audience.
Laughing releases hormones which make people like you more.
Jokes can be especially important in a bad timeslot, like right after lunch.

But jokes can also be a very effective way to offend your audience. Or bore them.

If you're not 100% sure that your joke is going to knock it out of the park,
you may wish to reconsider using it.

Planning on using a joke?  Test-drive it with someone -- preferfably someone
different from you, like different gender/background.
