note:

10min

Welcome back! I hope you had a great lunch! Just quickly now, I'd like everyone to stand up. OK, now stretch your arms up to the sky. Lean to your left. Lean to your right. Turn to the person next to you and give them a high five. OK, post-lunch wake-up is over. Have a seat & we'll get started talking about audience interaction.
