## Interacting With The Audience

### Asking for a response

note:

V

Sometimes, during your performance, you want to ask the audience to chime in on a topic. For instance, "Raise your hand if you've ever…" or "Who knows what this $picture is?" 

With some audiences, they'll take this as an opportunity to start a freeform dialog. This can quickly lead to the performance getting out of your control.

Some ways to avoid that:

* Only take respondents who raise their hands.
* Phrase the question hypothetically and don't take respondents at all.
* If you take freeform responses shouted out from the audience, don't be afraid to say, "Yup, that's great. Moving on now…" Keep control of the performance.
