The basics for Q&A is pretty simple:
Let the audience know how long you have.
For public events, try to appear as fair as possible picking questioners.  
Maybe favor slightly folks who might be more shy (women, kids, minorities).
For private events, pick questioners by heirarchy (i.e., pick the boss first).

Repeat the question when people ask in any medium to large group.  That both
helps everyone hear the question, and also makes sure that you got the
question right.   Also, it's a nice touch to ask people's name, and it
lets you follow-up if you need to.
