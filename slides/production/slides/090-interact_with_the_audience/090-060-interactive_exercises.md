## Interacting With The Audience

### Interactive exercises

* Small-medium audiences
* Plan it carefully
* Have a script
* Limited scope, timing, materials
* Be ready to abort & do something else

note:

Interactive exercises work for some kinds of talks, but not most.  They
can be tremendously time-consuming.  You need to plan/script them very
carefully or they'll get completely out of hand.
