### Jokes

* Good but hard to do right

Jokes can be a very effective way to connect with your audience. Laughing releases hormones which make people like you more.

But jokes can also be a very effective way to offend your audience. Or bore them.

If you're not 100% sure that your joke is going to knock it out of the park, you may wish to reconsider using it.
