## Interacting With The Audience

### Before the talk starts

* Quick polling
* Announcements
* Pre-Q&A
* Get people to move to the front of the room

We mentioned earlier that it's a good idea to get to the room early. If there's a session before, sit in on it (you may learn something interesting, too!). As soon as the presentation area is available, head up there and start setting up. While you do this and in the down time before your talk, engage with the audience a bit. Chat with them. Ask them what their experience is with the topic you'll be covering. Take a poll: who here came the furthest to attend the event? You can see whether anyone has any questions they're hoping to get answered by your talk, or have any other talk-related questions.

This helps you become familiar to the audience as well as breaks the ice before you start your performance. You've already spoken with the audience. These people are all your friends now. This will be easy.

Another good thing to do before your talk starts: As people come in, ask them whether they'd mind sitting up closer to the front of the room. It's easier to present to a group who is consolidated in that way. As well, people scattered throughout the room makes it look empty and can sap your confidence. Not everyone will be willing to move up, but most will. Don't worry if not everyone does it.
