## Interacting With The Audience

### "Jesus in the Audience"

![jesus](images/jesus.jpg)

note:

This special case refers to having someone really important and brilliant in
the audience; often someone who knows the subject of your talk much better
than you.  The best response is usually to ignore him/her.  Possibly he's
checking on your speaking style; possibly he's actually checking email.
Sometimes it works to refer a question you can't answer to Jesus.
