## Interacting With The Audience

### That Guy In the Third Row

note:

There always seems to be one in every medium to large audience: the guy who
thinks he should be on the stage instead of you.  This guy is especially
a problem for women speakers.  You need to be ruthless about cutting him
off.  Even if he's someone important, you need to be polite but firm.  You
can't let him waste the time of the whole rest of the audience.
