One is eye contact.  Making eye contact establishes a connection between 
you and the audience, and if you're paying attention to them they're 
more likely to pay attention to you.  Also, if you're making eye contact
you'll see how the audience is reacting to your talk, and know whether
to speed it up or slow it down if they're looking either bored or 
bewildered.  

However, you don't want to stand there and stare at one person -- you'll 
freak them out.  You also don't want to only look at your friends.  Not only 
does that show a lack of confidence, that won't tell you how the rest of
the audience is feeling about your performance.

The best method of eye contact I've found is called "floating".  It's when
you sweep back and forth, gently "floating" your gaze from one audience
member to another, making eye contact for about half a second each.  

Of course, this requires you to constantly look up from your speaker's 
notes and slides.  That requires practice, and maybe memorization.  It's a
good thing.
