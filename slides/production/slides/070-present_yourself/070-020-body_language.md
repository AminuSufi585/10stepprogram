We're complex creatures, evolved and shaped by hundreds of thousands of years of experiences. Therefore we still react primally to certain physical actions.

One of those odd little reactions: Studies have shown that we trust people more if they take a more open stance. Sweeping but not ostentatious arm movements, shoulders back and chest expanded, feet shoulder width apart, head back and chin up. Theories are that we trust these people more because of the position of vulnerability shown by an open stance. They trust us and are being vulnerable, so we trust them. 

Those who are hostile or who might hurt us are usually hunched down, scrunched over, trying to protect themselves from attack. They don't trust us, so we don't trust them.

As well, we are drawn to friendly and engaging people. Sincere smiles attract people to us and make them want to listen to what we have to say. Note: These are sincere smiles. These are hard to fake, so you have to legitimately be having a good time up there, or at least have prepared enough to feel confident in your perfomance.

If you watch videos of great speakers, you'll find that they're fairly mobile. They're not hiding behind a podium; they're out there in front of the audience, wandering slightly but always presenting their front to the watchers.

And speaking of video, recording yourself while practicing will help you locate any annoying little habits you may have. Do you hold your arms in and close to your body? Do you not look at the audience? When I did this, I learned that I had a bad habit of standing on one foot. I know, weird, right? But watching videos of myself allowed to to break myself of that habit.
