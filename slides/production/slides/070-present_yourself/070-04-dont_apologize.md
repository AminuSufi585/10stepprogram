## Present Yourself

### Never apologize for being an inexperienced speaker

* Justâ€¦just don't.

Frequently I'll go to conference sessions and one of the first things out of a speaker's mouth is an apology because they've never done this before, or they've only spoken at meetups, or they've never presented to an audience that size. Please don't do this. If you have taken the time to craft your story, to practice your performance, and to present yourself, I can guarantee you that not only will you have the confidence of an experienced speaker, you'll also have a better performance than 75% of them out there. Don't apologize for being inexperienced. If you say nothing, odds are good that your audience will never know.
