### Sharing code

Share your code online if at all possible

* Lets audience follow along
* Lets them retry your demo
* Leads to further interaction/fans

note:

If you're doing a demo or code example, share it! Github or whatever, it
doesn't matter.  Sharing the code is probably more important than
presenting it.  People who can't really see/follow the code on the screen
may test-drive it later ... and this is an excellent way to share your
technical knowledge/quality of your products.  Wheras if you demo and
don't share code, people will wonder if you faked it.
