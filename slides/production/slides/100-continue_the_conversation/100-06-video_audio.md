### Video/audio

* Making videos/audio
* Sharing video/audio

note:

Some conferences will record video, or audio+slides, of your talk.  Make sure you
get a copy and share it with your social media network.  For demo-mostly
presentations, consider doing your own screencast and posting it to a video
channel.  A good video can reach 50X as many people are were at the conference.

Possibly you have a video from your rehearsal?
