Great way to make sure you end on time: "meet me in the hall"

Continuing starts with the hallway track.  If you've grabbed your audience,
some of them will want to talk.  Bring them with you out of the room to chat,
maybe to lunch, coffee, or beers if you're in a before-break slot.  This both lets
you chat under more relaxed circumstances, and clears the room for the next speaker.

If you can schedule a Birds of a Feather or other session, even if it's at your
company booth, make sure that you plug it on the last slide.  For people who
can't stay, make sure your social networking contacts are prominently displayed.

Also: don't forget to take business cards to your presentation!  People still
use them.
