### Getting feedback

#### How to use feedback

* Grains of salt
* Improving your talk

note:

Reviewers are usually at the extremes of the spectrum. Strong feelings
motivate participation in ratings. Meh feelings? People often don't bother reviewing.
Do try to get insights out of feedback, but don't assume it's representative.
