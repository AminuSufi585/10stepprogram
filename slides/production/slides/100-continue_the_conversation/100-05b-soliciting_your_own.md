### Getting feedback

#### Soliciting on your own

* Online services
  * Joind.in
  * Google Forms
  * SurveyMonkey
  * Social networks

note:

Far too often, conferences do not provide a feedback mechanism.  Sometimes you
need to harvest your own.

For small/private events, this means approaching a friendly audience member
and getting some private feedback.  For large, public events, you can maybe
do a survey.
