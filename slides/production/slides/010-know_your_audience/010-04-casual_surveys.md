As mentioned on the previous slide, doing a little social media archaeology can help you learn more about your potential audience. But you don't have to limit yourself just to past posts: You can use networks to survey your potential audience.

You can do this in multiple (non-exclusive) ways. You can ask direct questions of your network such as, "Hey, if someone were to talk about scaling microservices, what would you like to hear?" or "What sort of challenges have you had transitioning to a schemaless database?"

Or you can do what we did: Create a survey on GoogleForms & share that with your network. You can gather a lot more information this way and, if you make the survey quick/easy to fill in you may able to engage a lot more people than you would with one-off questions.
