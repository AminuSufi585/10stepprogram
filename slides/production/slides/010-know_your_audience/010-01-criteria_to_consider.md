## Know Your Audience

### Some Criteria To Consider

* Technical level
* Expected audience size
* Human language
* Culture
* Current events in the community

The relevant audience criteria will differ based upon your intended conference, but there are several elements which are common to most tech conference audiences. For instance, what is the technical level of the average attendee? Are they seasoned devs? Are they more on the marketing side of things? Are they new contributors?

The expected size of your audience is very important when preparing your material. For instance, if you're doing a tutorial like this you'll need to know how many handouts to have ready. As well, you may choose to present a different version of your slides in a small and intimate setting than you would in a ballroom which seats 300.

Most people take for granted that their audience will understand English, but that's not always the case. Rather than assuming and making an ass of yourself on stage, take a moment to confirm the spoken language of your audience.

As well, many speakers overlook the cultural considerations of their audience. This culture can spring from the geographical location of the event, but also can spring from the sort of attendees the event expects to attract. For instance, you may present differently at FOSDEM than you would at a corporate event such at Oracle World.

Do a little research to learn of the latest events in the community to which you're going to present. Have they recently had a monumentous release (yay! Perl6!)? Have they recently lost an important community member ( :-( Debian)? Be aware of these milestones and landmines before you start to frame your presentation.
