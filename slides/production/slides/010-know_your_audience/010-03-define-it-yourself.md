## Know Your Audience

### Tell them what they need to know

**Bad:**

"For mid-level system administrators."

**Good:**

"Attendees should be comfortable with the Linux command line and git,
but need not have used Docker before."

Note:

You can help define what audience you want/expect by putting it right there
in the talk description.  Categories given by the conference are seldom adequate;
tell your potential audience what they need to know, NOT who you expect them to
be.  I mean, what's an "mid-level system administrator" anyway?
