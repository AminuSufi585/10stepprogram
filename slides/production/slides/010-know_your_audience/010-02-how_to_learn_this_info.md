It's rare that this sort of information is simply offered to you. To be honest, most conference organizers stand to do as good of a job communicating audience information up-front to speakers as they do to potential sponsors. So how do you go about gathering this information?

The most obvious and useful answer is also the one which people don't usually think of immediately: Just ask the organizers. In order to plan a technical conference you need to answer the question, "For whom are we doing this? Who's going to show up?" So if anyone knows what to expect in your audience, it'll be the organizers.

Another way to learn about your audience is to take to social media to see who's expressing excitement or interest in the event. This can lead to some great insights into the nature of your potential audience.

While checking out social networking, don't forget to look for posts about prior editions of the event. That as well as past event schedules can provide a lot of information of what to expect from the event and your audience.

If nothing else, you can always define for yourself for which audience you're aiming. In the description for your talk, be very explicit about its expected technical level, in which language it'll be presented, and any other necessary pre-requisites. This will allow your audience to pre-select.
