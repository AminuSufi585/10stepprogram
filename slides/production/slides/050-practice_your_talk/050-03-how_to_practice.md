There are right ways and wrong ways to practice. The most common wrong way? Sitting down, paging through your slides "reading" through and "performing" them in your head. That's reading, it's not performing. The way you emote things in your head will be different than how you do it in speech.

The ideal situation: Practice as you'll perform.

Will you be standing up with a clicker, presenting to a room of people? Try to find the opportunity to do that. Local meetups are great for this, but perhaps you have some very patient and understanding friends who'd be willing to listen and provide feedback.

If you don't have the opportunity to practice for other people, do it at least for yourself. Or for your dog. Or your hamster. But not your cat, since its too harsh a critic.

Once you're more comfortable with the material, practice in front of a mirror to try to see and correct some of your physical and stance foibles.

Regardless of the method you choose, try to record yourself. Many of us hate watching videos of ourselves (myself included), but few things are quite as effective at helping you spot and correct potential problems with your presentation and performance.
