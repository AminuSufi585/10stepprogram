## Practice Your Talk

### This is NOT optional

No. Justâ€¦no.

You might think, "Hey, I just spent a lot of time writing this. I know it. I have this, no problem." But, no, you're wrong. Writing is not the same as performing.

YOU. MUST. PRACTICE. Practicing allows you to become more comfortable with speaking the material rather than thinking it. It gives you the chance to develop good habits of posture and delivery. It makes the process more second nature, ensuring a considerably better chance of everything going smoothly.

But don't take my word for it. In the survey we did, a full 25% of the respondents said that the one bad speaking practice that they would eliminate right now if they had the power was "unpracticed/unprepared presenter." That was nearly twice as many as the next most popular answer for that part of the survey.
