## Practice Your Talk

### Editing

Aside from helping you become more comfortable with performing the material & with hitting your times, another valuable benefit of practicing is to expose flaws with your writing.

None of us get it wrong the first time. There are wordings which don't quite work. There are transitions which don't transit. There is too much content. There is not enough. You don't know these things until you run through the material a few times.

It's usually best if you practice for comfortability and editing purposes first, and only afterward work on hitting your times. Why time something which is still in flux? As well, when practicing to expose potential edits you may need to pause to take notes. This can mess up any times you're trying to measure.
