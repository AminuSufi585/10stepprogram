## Practice Your Talk

### Avoids reading from your slides

* Even if you have a lot of speaker notes

note:

V

Have you ever sat in a talk only to have a speaker read their slides? The very thing at which you're looking at that moment? As though you were some sort of illiterate clown? Sure you have, we all have. That's mostly a flaw in the writing (too many points on a slide), but the presenting equivalent is putting all of your text into the speaker notes instead of on the slide itself, and then doing a dramatic reading of those notes rather than using them as a guide. It's obvious and it makes for a disengaged speaker and an even more disengaged audience. It is, simply, a poor performance.

People do this sort of thing as a crutch: They don't know the material well enough, so they write it all down longhand rather than take the time to practice and learn it.

Which is not to say that having speaker notes is a bad thing. Far from it! If you look at the slides for our talk you'll see an over-abundance of speaker notes! But that's because we want the slides to be useful even in PDF format without us there to explain them. Our notes are there to provide value after the talk, not as a crutch during it.
