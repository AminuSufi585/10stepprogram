## Practice Your Talk

### Timing, pacing, and tools

* Allow extra time
* Write down section times
  * Practice each section separately to hit its time
* Use a timer

Most new speakers I know hit both ends of the time spectrum during their practice and performance runs. 

During practice, they learn that they have far too much material and end up having to cut and reformat a lot of slides.

During performance, they're often so nervous they speak very quickly and end early.

Therefore we recommend setting times for each section and then practicing each section until you feel comfortable with it and can hit the time limit you need. Then do it again, just to be sure it wasn't a fluke.

When you perform, use the timer function on your presentation software (or an external timer) to help you hit your marks.

No matter what, please be aware of the fact that you're likely only one speaker among many at that event. If you run over, you eat into the time the following speaker has to set up and prepare to perform at their best. Please respect the speaker who follows you: END ON TIME.
