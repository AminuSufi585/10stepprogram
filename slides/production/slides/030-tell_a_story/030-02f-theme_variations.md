Show several different ways to do something and compare/contrast.

Theme and variations is one I hardly ever see, and that's a shame
because it's pretty effective.  It's where you show several different
ways to accomplish a task or tasks, and compare or contrast them.
This is different from enlightentment because the variations are 
not necessarily better than each other, but more often tradeoffs.

The most effective version of this I saw was at Pycon 2014 in a 
session on looping; it showed the same functions implemented 
three or four different ways, and really helped people understand
what iterators were for.
