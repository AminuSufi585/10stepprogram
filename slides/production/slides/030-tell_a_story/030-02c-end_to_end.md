One story which engages the audience more because
they have something to follow is "end-to-end", where
you go through a subject from the beginning to the end,
or top to bottom, or from basic to advanced.  Basically
you take the logical linear structure of your subject
and follow it.  

An example of this would be a talk which traces response
time delay in a web application from the browser to the
database server and back.  The difference between
end-to-end and catalog is the difference between an
ordered and an unordered list.
