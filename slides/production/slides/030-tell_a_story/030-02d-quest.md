## Tell A Story

### Quest

A search for solutions to a problem (maybe success)

_Example: Building a Robot Anti-Squirrel Gun_

_Example: Crashed Container Root Cause Analysis_

The Quest is much more engaging for the audience because
it often involves an element of mystery.  If you really want
to get people to close their laptops and listen, it's
a good way to go.  Usually the quest is a search for a
solution to some kind of technical problem.  Most 
post-mortem talks also are basically quests; they 
start with failure and then go through a search for root
causes and fixes.
