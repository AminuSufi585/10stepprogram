## Tell A Story

### Show And Tell

Demo something, then examine and explain how you did it.

Show and Tell is fun, but it doesn't get used as much as
it should because most presenters are afraid of demos.  The
way it works is that you show something: a demo, a completed
project, an annoucement.  Then you go through in detail how
the thing they just saw works.  It's an especially effective
technique if you're going to present something where the
audience might have low expectations of success, like
demos of a new technology or difficult technique.
