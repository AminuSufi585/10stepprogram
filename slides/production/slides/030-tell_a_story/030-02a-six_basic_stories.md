Christopher Booker has a book about the seven basic adventure plots
where he points out that all adventure stories follow one
of a few basic storylines.  Ian Dees and I, when we worked on
the original GGTT, realized that all technical talks followed
one of six basic "stories" or a combination of them.  

So this is your menu of potential storylines for your talk.
There is actually a seventh "story", which is "amorphous
mess", but I'm not going to list that because it's not really
a story as such.
