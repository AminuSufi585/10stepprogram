## Tell A Story

### Catalog

A list of items with details

_Example: this section_

Note:

Josh

Catalog is the simplest story and probably
the least interesting.  It's "here is a list
of items and the details of each".  This section
of the tutorial, for example, is a Catalog. 
Sometimes Catalog is the most appropriate format
for your presentation, but if you can use one
of the other story types you should probably
do so.
