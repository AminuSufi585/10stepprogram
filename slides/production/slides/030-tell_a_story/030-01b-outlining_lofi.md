But my favorite method, personally, is the "lo-fi": mind-mapping in meatspace. Get a big stack of cards or sticky notes and then fill them with ideas. One card, one idea. After you've emptied your brain, just start reorganizing the cards into a physical representation of an outline. As you do this, you'll undoubtedly find a lot of cards which don't fit in (set them aside; don't use them), and several which are missing (create them).

Once you're done organizing your cards or sticky notes, transfer that information to a "proper" outline. This will form the basis of your talk.

Pro-tip: Rather than spending a lot of money on "real" index cards or sticky notes, just go to your local independent print shop. They do a lot of projects which lead to cardstock trimmings, much of which is perfect for your purposes. If it's too large, just get them to cut them down to 2x3" or whatever's easiest. I've done this several times and always gotten hundreds of cards for less than $1. They're just going to recycle this, else, so you're doing your budget and the environment a favor by putting those trimmings to good use.

Most important: The best system is the system you'll use.
