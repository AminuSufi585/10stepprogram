Don't just dive into your presentation. I mean, if you know for sure that this is a method that works for you, by all means do so. But it's pretty rare that this is a winning strategy. Instead, take some time to outline your talk before you start writing it. For some conferences, like Pycon US, you have to do this step during the CFP process, but it's smart to do for all talks.

When doing this, don't be concerned about order or structure or whether you don't have enough information (you will) or whether you have too much (you will). Just do a brain dump of everything you can think and want to say about your chosen topic. You can put it in order later.

There are several methods which you can use for this. One is the "hi-fi" approach: use software. We're technologists! We can do anything through software! Some of the software which is useful for this approach are mind-mapping apps. Online Kanban boards can also be called into play here.

Mind-mapping: freemind, bubbl.us, scapple (scrivener)
Kanban: Trello, Huboard, Taiga
