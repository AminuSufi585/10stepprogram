## Dealing With Demos

### Fake it 'til you make it

When to fake a demo:

* Decrease risk
* Prevent typos
* As a failed demo fallback

Given all the risks associated with demo failure,
many presenters choose to "fake" demos.  I don't
advise this in general, but fake demos are a 
good backup in case the real demo fails, and
also for demos which depend on likely-to-fail 
setup like working internet.

And, frankly, given that the time required for
a good demo can exceed the rest of your preso 
prep by 2x, sometimes faking it is just the best 
use of your time.
