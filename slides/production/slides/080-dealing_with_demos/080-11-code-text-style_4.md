Also, some general tips.  Break up long lines, but
with obvious visual cues like backslashes and indenting.

Even though it's not consistent with PEP8, align text
and operators to make it more readable.

Green text "vibrates" on older LCD projectors.  So unless
you know for sure that you're going to have a new AV system,
it's a good idea to avoid using lots of green text.
