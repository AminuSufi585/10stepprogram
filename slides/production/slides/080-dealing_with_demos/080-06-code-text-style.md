## Dealing With Demos

### Text style for code

* use a monospace font (lucida, courier)
* same color rules for slide text
* colorize and use a white background

Whether you're putting it on the slides, or using your editor
you'll need to follow some good text style rules if you expect
the audience to read your code (and if you don't, why show it?).
First, use a monospace font, like Courier so that code lines up.
Second, code needs to follow the same color rules of metal/color
as slide text.  This means that if you're going to do colorization
-- something I recommend -- then you'll need to use a light background
so that you have a reasonable color palette available.
