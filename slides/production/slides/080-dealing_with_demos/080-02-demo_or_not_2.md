## Dealing With Demos

### To demo or not demo

Don't demo because:

* Nothing to demo
* Demo failure
* Time
* Audience may not care

That said, there are a bunch of reasons NOT to do a demo. The biggest one that people
fear is that the demo will fail, resulting in embarassment. This isn't as big of a real
issue as it is a fear; most audiences are OK with demo failure because they're used 
to it. Your employer may not be, though.

The bigger reason not to do it is that setting up and doing a demo is very time-consuming,
and audiences don't seem to consider it very important. So you may want to stick 
to the lowest levels of demo, or only do ones you think are fun.

Also, some talks just don't lend themselves to demos, because they are "meta" or 
community-based.
