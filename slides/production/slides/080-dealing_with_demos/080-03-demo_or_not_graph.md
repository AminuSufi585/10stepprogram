note:

Before this tutorial we did a survey on experienced 
speaker/audience perceptions of what made a good talk good.
You'll notice that demos and exercises are way down the list
in things they consider important. Now, we don't know if this is
because demos aren't valuable, or because most are badly done,
but it does mean that a demo shouldn't be your first focus.
