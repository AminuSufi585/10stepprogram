## Dealing With Demos

### Level 1: showing code

How to display it?

* Slide
* GUI Editor
* Terminal + Editor

note:

The lowest level, presenting code, is the one you'll do the most often,
so it's important to get it right. Fortunately, this is mostly about
formatting.

Your first decision is how to show the code. Embedding in the slide is
the most obvious, and keeps the flow of the presentation. However, 
it's poorly suited to showing large amounts of code. You may want to
switch to your editor of choice.



* Colors
* Typefaces
* Lines of code per slide
* How to show a lot of code
  * Collapse/zoom
  * Terminal/text editor
  * Link rather than show
