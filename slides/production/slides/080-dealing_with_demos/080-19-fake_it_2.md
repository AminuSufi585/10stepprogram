## Dealing With Demos

### Fake it 'til you make it

How to fake a demo:

* screenshots
* video/screencast
* recorded shell session (ttyrec)
* interactive shell scripts (IO::prompt)

The simplest way to fake a demo is just to go through screenshots.
It gives the audience an idea of what things should look like without
a lot of demo prep.

A more sophisticated approach is to create a video or screencast.
This is a lot more work, but done skillfully, the audience may not
even know that it's not a live demo. Warning, though: obvious videos
in a presentation can put the audience to sleep.

For advanced terminal demos, there are some tools to "fake"
typing and response and instead display prerecorded output.
