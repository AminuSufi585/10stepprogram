## Dealing With Demos

### Text style for code

Most of all:

```html
<em>
Make your code example text big enough!
</em>
```

However, the biggest thing is to be bigger!  If you're
displaying code at less than 22pt, it's too small, and
26 to 32 is better.  Again, if you need to show more code,
use more slides or scroll!
