## Dealing With Demos

### Levels of demo

1. Show some code
2. Passive examination
3. Video narration
4. Show-and-execute
5. Build-and-execute

People think of demos as only "live interactive demo", but there are 
various levels, which escalate in terms of time involved to do them well,
and risk of failure.

The lowest level of demo is simple: show some code
from a working project.  This is something almost every technical presentation
should include. The second level is just a bit above that; explore 
an installation of a "working" example of the project/topic.

Graduating beyond that, you can record a video of yourself running
whatever it is and narrate over it during your talk. This is almost
as good as live execution without the risk of failure. Beware that audiences
often react poorly to videos, though.

The top two levels require the most setup and risk. 4 involves looking over 
a fully set up application/tool, then launching it to show it off. 5 adds the 
step of building that app/tool from scratch while the audience watches. The last
only really works if you're VERY experienced in whatever you're doing.
