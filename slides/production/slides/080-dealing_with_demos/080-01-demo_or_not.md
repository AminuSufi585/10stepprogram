## Dealing With Demos

### To demo or not demo

Demo because:

* Prove that it works
* Show that it's easy
* Entertain the audience
* Structure presentation
* You promised to
* Fun!

Note:

Many speaker tutorials have focused on how difficult live demos are to
carry off. This has new speakers gun-shy about demos.  Since this is about 
technical presentations, you should consider including some kind of demo,
at least showing some functional code.
