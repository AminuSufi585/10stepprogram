## Dealing With Demos

### Make Your Terminal Text Bigger!

_Do it now._

Don't wait until the demo starts.

But the biggest thing is to MAKE YOUR TERMINAL BIGGER.
We're talking 26 to 36 points here.  People have to
read it from the back row.

Don't wait until the first time you display a terminal
window and treat the audience to the sight of you awkwardly
fiddling with text size and terminal windows.  Do it
before you start the presentation, ideally as soon as
you plug in your laptop.  

Many terminals support "profiles" and you can create
profiles speficially for presentation.
