Depending upon your audience, event, and topic, you may find you need sections which aren't typically found in presentations. That's great! There is no hard and fast rule of what to include in your presentation besides, "Whatever's necessary to be effective."

If you have a longer form talk, just as this one, a Table of Contents can be very useful to people to track how far along in the presentation the speaker is. Also, if there is a break involved, it tells the audience what they might miss if they duck out and don't return after, say, lunch (which we certainly hope you won't do). But this section can sometimes be very helpful for shorter form talks as well. It's up to you whether you decide to include it.

Josh believes that the About/Intro is a special and optional section. This is one of the very few points on which we disagree. Definitely, people spend far too much time talking about themselves at the start of a talk. We don't need to know much more than who you are, where you work (especially if your company is paying you to be there; they deserve the extra exposure), where to address Tweets, what you hope to accomplish in the talk, and why you're the person to do it. If this takes more than 30 seconds then you're doing it wrong.

A recap slide is useful if you've covered a number of subjects or if you'd like to emphasize how those subjects all tie together at the end. I've personally also used them as summary slides of which people take photos to help remember what to follow up on later.

More information is a slide which I love. Very often as you're composing your talk you'll find that you have a lot more information than you can cover in the time allotted. Enter 'More Information'! You can prepare resources in advance and link to them on this slide. My own use of this slide is typically to direct people to additional documentation, examples, and–most especially–to bibliographies I build of all references from the talk as well as additional supporting materials. I use the open source citation service Zotero for this purpose.
