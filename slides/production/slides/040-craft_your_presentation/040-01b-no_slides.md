There are a few methods of doing non-slide presentations, and some
of them can be very effective.  Sometimes a no slides is the best way
to present a given topic, especially if it's intellectually
hard to grasp, or if you audience has slideshow fatigue.  

The one I've used a few times is the demo-only presentation, where
there's no slides, just a terminal or browser where I do a bunch
of demos.  I take care of title and contact slides using a 
text editor.

More exotic ones I've seen work on other occasions are group exercises
and a puppet show, like "PostgreSQL replication through puppets".  
Whiteboards, while more mundane, are a good way to make your audience
participate in the talk; somehow a whiteboard feels more 
communal than a preset deck of slides.

Most of the time, though, you're going to have slides.
