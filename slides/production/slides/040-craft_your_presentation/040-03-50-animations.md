## Craft Your Presentation

### Transitions & Animations

#### Use them sparingly!

* Only when they make sense for the _content_
* Make transitions consistent
* Test playback speed under load

Animations and transitions, used judiciously, can illustrate
specific things about your subject.  You can use an animation to show
and important process, and you can use a special transition
to show that a particular slide is an aside or something.  But
these things should be special, not more than 1 or 2 per presentation.

Used repeatedly, animations and transitions are distracting and
tiring for the audience, and will cause them to lose track of 
what you're presenting.
