This system uses "colors" and "metals".  Metals are yellow and white, for gold
and silver.  Colors are everything else. You can put a metal on a color, or a color
on a metal, but never a metal on a metal or a color on a color.

This may seem like a silly achaic system, but consider this: anywhere you go, 1-2% of
your audience will be completely colorblind, and maybe 10%-20% of them will be blind
to one or two colors. More importantly, when projectors start to go, one of the first
things that happens is that one or more colors washes out.  So you really can't depend
on differing colors without sufficient contrast.

You'll notice that this presentation has an off-black background, and all text is 
white or gold.  We wouldn't choose this if we were going to show lots of colorized
code, because you can't do much colorization if all you can use is white and gold.
