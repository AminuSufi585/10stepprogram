## Craft Your Presentation

### Typefaces and Type

* Stick to simple + common fonts
  <br /> _Arial, Helvetica, Times, etc._
* No more than three per presentation
  <br /> _two is better_
    * one for titles
    * one for text
    * one for code

The rule on fonts is: don't go crazy.  Stick to well-known and 
familiar typefaces, because you want your audience to read your
text easily and quickly, and they can only do that if the lettering
is familiar.

Unless you're presenting on graphic design or typefaces, you really
don't want to use more than three, and two is even better.
