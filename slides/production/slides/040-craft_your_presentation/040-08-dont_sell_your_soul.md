## Craft Your Presentation

### You don't have to sell your soul

* Work mandated slides

note:

This is a sensitive subject for many speakers. I'm grateful I work for a huge corporation with a soul. HPE doesn't dictate my presentation slides and allows me to be me and to craft my content to match my audience. Many speakers are not so lucky and are asked to use work-mandated slide templates, splashed with corporate branding on every page.

I can and will not advise that you tell these people to go pound sand. That would be professional suicide. You cannot put your job at risk for something as relatively minor as a slide template.

Consider: Is your job paying you to be at the conference? Paying your way in any manner? In that case, they're entitled to getting some props. But we'll get to that in a moment.

But if you're at the conference on your own and you're not representing them in any way, you may not need to use that work-mandated slide template. Discuss it with your manager to see whether you can convince them that the template makes no sense in this context.

And, even if you are being paid to be there, you may be able to negotiate a more subtle slide template. Arguing (validly, one hopes), that if this audience is presented with such flagrant branding they will walk away with a lower opinion of the company, you may be able to convince the powers who are that you should use a different template for that event.
