note:

For example, name a few of the things wrong with this slide.

Here's some:

* WAY too much text
* Text at the bottom of the slide
* Too many cryptic abbreviations
* Too many topics for one slide
* No clear structure or topic for the slide
* Large, irrelevant photo on the left
  (WTF does that ship have to do with anything?)

So, don't be this person.  People will notice this slide,
but for all the wrong reasons.
