We are in the Golden Days of presentation software. You have the old standbys, of course: LibreOffice, Keynote, and Powerpoint and, to a lesser degree, Google Present. These get the job done quite adequately and are where most folks start.

But aside from the Big Four (OK, 3.5), these days you have a host of shiny new options from which to choose. This talk, for instance, is coming to you by way of reveal.js, a Node.js project. Other options are Prezi, Remark, and Haiku Deck among others.

Pick whichever one suits your needs, but remember that whatever you select will have a learning curve.
