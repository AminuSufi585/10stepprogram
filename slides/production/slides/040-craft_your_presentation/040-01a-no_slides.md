## Craft Your Presentation

### No slides?

note:

So, here's a thought experiment.  Imagine that you have to
present without slides.  Maybe slides are prohibited by the venue;
maybe Libreoffice is completely wedged and you can't recover
your slides.  How would you go about presenting your topic 
without any slides?
