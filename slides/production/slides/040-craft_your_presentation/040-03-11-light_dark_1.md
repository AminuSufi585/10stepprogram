Presentations in dark rooms, or where you're going to 
be doing a lot of terminal demos with a dark background,
should be dark.  Also, if you're going to be video-recorded,
you want to use a dark background because bright slides 
are hard for the camera to film due to glare.

If you're in a bright room, or if you're going to have a
lot of colorized code (more on this later), then you're going
to want to have a light background for the slides.  This
also works better for clipart which often has a white 
background.
