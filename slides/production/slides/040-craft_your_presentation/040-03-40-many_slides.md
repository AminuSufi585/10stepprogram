Most of all, you don't want to jam up your slides with
a wall of text.  This is something I call "Dr. Bronner's
school of slide design," and it seems to express some kind
of phobic fear of whitespace.  There's not a single slide
package I know which charges by the slide, so use as 
many slides as you need.  I've been known to use over a 
hundred slides for a lightning talk.
