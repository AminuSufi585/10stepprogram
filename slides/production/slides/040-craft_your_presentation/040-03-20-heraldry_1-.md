Having chosen light or dark backgrounds, we can select
the rest of your color palette.  Here we're going to get some
professional guidance.  The professionals I have in mind
are the 14th-century French college of heralds.  Confronted
with the problem of being able to clearly make out someone's
coat of arms 300 yards away across a smoky battlefield, 
they devised a system of color contrast which is still used
today by the US Highway department.   Because it works.
