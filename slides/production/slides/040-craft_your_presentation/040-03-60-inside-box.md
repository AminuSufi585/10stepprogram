## Think Inside The Box

note: 

Josh

My final thought is "think inside the box".  The box here is
one which is about 10% inside the top, left, and right edge of the
slide page, and 20% above the bottom. The reason for this is that
many things will cause one edge or another of your slides to be
blocked, whether it's project problems, a too-small screen, the
heads of audience members, or video driver issues.  Yes, this
doesn't give you a lot of space to work with, which is a reason
to use lots more slides!

You never, ever want to put anything important at the bottom 
of a slide; that's the place for footnotes and logos to go.
