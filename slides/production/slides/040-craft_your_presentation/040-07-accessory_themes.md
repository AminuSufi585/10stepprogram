## Craft Your Presentation

If you watch talks on YouTube, Internet Archive, Vimeo, or what have you, you'll see a lot of really interesting approaches to theming your presentation. This can include colors, images, wording, etc. Theming can be very effective for tying your presentation together (much like a fine rug in a room). However, it does have some drawbacks.

First of all: it adds additional time to preparations. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as a properly-themed talk can more than pays back the effort it takes to construct. However, the key there is "properly-themed."

Which brings me to the second drawback: When done poorly, these are distracting at best and offensive at worst. Please be careful and thorough when theming your talk.

A third drawback is related to the second: Themes run the risk of being cutesy, twee, and contrived. If you think your theme is trying too hard, it probably is.
