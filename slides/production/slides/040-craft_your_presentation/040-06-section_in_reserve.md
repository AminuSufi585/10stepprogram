One trick that frequent speakers use is to prepare an extra section. This is information which is interesting but not vital. Placed at the end of the talk, this section is your ace in the hole. If you're running long, you can easily cut it with no one the wiser. But if you have extra time on your hands, you can present this section and provide further value to your audience.

This is also a great section to include if you're re-using a talk but your new audience has a different perspective than prior. While you still have to edit and customize your talk for that audience and event, often a lot of the major changes can be batched in a bonus section at the end of the presentation. Just make sure you have enough time available to cover the extra material!
