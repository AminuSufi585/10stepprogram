## Have An Idea

### Know your topic

* Something you know well
* Something you _care about_

<br />
#### Don't know enough?

* Research!
* Hack some demos

Given that enthusiasm and knowledge are two of the three most important factors 
in how people percieve your talk, you need to pick something where you can display
both.  This means that if you need to present on a topic you didn't choose --
for work or whatever -- you need to make it yours.  

This means you need to be prepared to research your topic if it's not something
you know really well already.  For code presentations, I find it's helpful to 
build a demo even if I'm not going to show it during the talk; I learn a lot
about the technology that way.
