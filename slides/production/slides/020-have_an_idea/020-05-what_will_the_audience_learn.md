## Have An Idea

### What will the audience learn?

By the end, the audience should:

* Learn something useful
* Learn something enlightening
* Be able to do something they couldn't
* Do something specific

What do you want from the audience?

note:

The audience should have some take-away from
the talk which is specific.  They should learn something,
or do something, or not do something after they see
your talk.  Not only is this important for your talk
to have focus, it's important for the CFP in order
to get your talk accepted and get people to attend
it.  An hour of someone's time is valuable, don't
waste it.
