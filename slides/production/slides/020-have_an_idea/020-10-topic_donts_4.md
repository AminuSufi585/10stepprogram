#### Sales/marketing pitch

_save it for the expo floor_

The most common version of Bait and Switch is, of course,
a "brocureware" or "marketing" talk.  Folks come in expecting
something technical and you give them a sales seminar.  Save
it for the Expo floor!  That's what that's for.

Sometimes you are explicitly giving a "sponsored talk" in 
which case the audience is expecting a sales pitch and that's
OK.  It's all about adhering to audience expectations.
