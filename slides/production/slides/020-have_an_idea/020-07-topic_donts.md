_make the topic your own or don't present it_

There's a few pitfalls to avoid in topic selection.  
One is never to do someone else's presentation.  You'll
suck at it because you're not them.  Even if you need to do a
presentation someone else developed, rework it and make it
your own.  And never agree to present a topic you really
don't know if you can avoid it.  If your boss asks you too,
point out that it will be counter-productive.
