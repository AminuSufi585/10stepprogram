Five minutes is a lightning talk; you can basically cover one to five items, 
very briefly.  20 to 30 minutes is kind of an extended lightning talk, where 
you can either cover more items, or cover each item in more depth/technical
detail.

45 to 60 minutes is an "in depth" technical talk, which should either cover
a small set of items in full technical detail, or survey most of a particular
subject.  In a tutorial, of course, you can cover all of a subject in 
great detail.
