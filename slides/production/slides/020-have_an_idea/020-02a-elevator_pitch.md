Once you have your general topic, you need a clear message to deliver
to the audience.  It needs to be clear to both them and to you.  
Essentially this is a sales pitch, an elevator pitch.  I've found that
if you can't express your topic in a single long sentence, it's 
probably because you're not clear what you want to say.  And if you're
not clear, the audience won't be clear either.

Most technical talks fall into simple patterns like the above.  A good
topic sentence should include:

1. WHAT you will be presenting
2. WHO you are addressing it to
3. WHY they should watch it

This is also important for the CFP.  Your topic sentence can be the first
sentence of your CFP pitch.
