#### Incomplete Projects

_unless your talk is a request for help_

note:

Given that you often have to submit talks 6 months in advance, 
it's tempting to submit something which you've just started working
on thinking that you'll complete it in time for the conference. 
Don't do it!  The only acceptable "incomplete project" talk
is one where you've come to the conference to recruit 
contributors ... and it better say so in the talk description.
