## Getting Ready To Speak

### Seven days before

* Schedules? Yeah, they can change. One speaker dropping out for a family emergency can lead to a complete reschedule of who's speaking when and where.
* While you're looking at that schedule, confirm that your speaking slot is as long as you remember it being. As well, double check that you haven't mis-remembered the promises of your talk description.
* Is your talk up against another popular speaker? There's nothing to be done about this but knowing it in advance can help motivate you to do more promotion of your talk in advance of the event as well as setting your expectations lower as far as audience attendance.
* Do you need any special equipment for your talk? Perhaps you have two speakers and need two microphones? Verify with the organizers that this sort of stuff will be OK.

Minimize day-of surprises. Check these things out in advance.
