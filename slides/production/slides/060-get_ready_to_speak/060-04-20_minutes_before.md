## Getting Ready To Speak

### Twenty minutes before

(Or session prior)

* Go to the bathroom
  * Double-check clothes, hair, teeth, fly
* Be in the presentation room

note:

V

* Ideally, you're sitting in the presentation before. It gives you a better sense of the room and leads to you feeling more comfortable in the space.
* Just before your talk, take one final visit to the toilet to deal with any final needs. While you're there, make sure everything is in order.
