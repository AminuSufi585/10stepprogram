* Double-check your phone and other devices are set to minimal interrupt mode.
* Do you have fidgety hands? Please empty your pockets. If you don't you're likely to be fiddling with things in there throughout your talk and that's just distracting.
* Also distracting? Your lanyard. It's particularly problematic if you're in a situation with a lot of lighting. No one needs you to wear that while you're in front of a crowd, so set it aside somewhere safe for the duration of your talk.
* Even if you don't think you'll need to, if there's a power plug near the podium please take the time to plug in. You never know when an app is going to go rogue and start consuming battery power.
* If you need internet for a demo or other elements of your presention, do a final check that it's in working order. Often events will have thoughtful and thorough organizers (such as this one) who provide hardlines for presenters. This makes life much easier for you.
