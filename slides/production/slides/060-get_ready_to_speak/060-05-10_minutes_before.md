## Getting Ready To Speak

### Ten minutes before

* Turn off phone
  * Verify all apps are off/silenced
* Empty pockets
* Remove lanyard
* **Plug in machine**
* Verify internet (if needed)

note:

who?
time?

Empty your pockets so you're not tempted to fiddle with things in them.

Lanyards glint in the light & are distracting. Ditch it.
