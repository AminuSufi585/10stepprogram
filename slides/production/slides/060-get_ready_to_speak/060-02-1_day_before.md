## Getting Ready To Speak

### One day before

* Double-check schedule
* Have a look at the room
* Test the projector
* Check out other equipment
* Prepare backup slides
* Do another run-through
* Get some sleep

note:

V

* Make sure there are no 11th hour changes to the schedule (they happen all the time).
* What do you think of the layout of the room? Does it match your presenting style? For instance, if you walk around a lot, can you do that in this space? If not, politely discuss options with the A/V team.
* How do your slides look on the projector in your room? You may find that they're unreadable or washed out. It's best to learn that the day before instead of in the middle of your presentation.
* Double-check that your special equipment will be ready for your session.
* Even if you're still tweaking, prepare a backup of your slides and put them somewhere other than your presentation machine: USB drive, Dropbox, both, all. Back up all the things.
* Run through your talk again. And again. You can always improve.
* For the love of dog, don't be out all night before your performance. Try to get to bed at a time which will allow you a reasonable amount of sleep. Yes, it would be more fun to go out with these amazing people you see around you, but please respect your audience and make the effort to come to your talk well-rested.

Can't do these things day before? Do morning of (during keynote)
