# Slide Styleguide

Just some things I'm finding myself doing as I work on the slides. Figured I'd write 'em down so we can discuss/rev/standardize.

* Slide title
  * H2s (## in markdown)
  * First letter of each word capitalized
* Subtitle
  * H3s (### in markdown)
  * Only first word of the subtitle capitalized
