# The Dongle List

What follows is a list of all of the inputs and outputs you should have with
you as a speaker for presentations, in order to be prepared for unknown
technical setup at your various locations.

For items which supply ports, they are listed in terms of the output or input
ports you need, rather than actual dongles.  If your laptop already has these
ports, then you don't need additional connectors.  Also:

* Put together all of your dongles/gizmos/cables in a "kit" which travels with you.
  Travel bathroom pouches and gizmo boards work well for this.
* Have two of each dongle/gizmo (kept separately), so that you can replace ones
  you lose during the course of a trip.
* Label dongles with your name.

The below lists are based on presenting from a laptop. If you are presenting
from a tablet, you might need slightly different equipment.

## Must-Haves

* XVGA
* HDMI
* Mini-DisplayPort
* Laptop power supply
* USB

## Good-to-Haves

* Wireless presentation remote (slide clicker)
* USB3 (may soon become a must-have)
* DVI
* Headphone sound jack for sound output
* External timer/clock (or phone app)
* USB cord for network tethering via cell

## Device/Tool Links

* [Logitech Wireless Presenter with timer](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/professional-presenter-r800?crid=11)
* [Targus Wireless Presenter](http://www.targus.com/us/wireless-presenter-with-laser-pointer-amp16us)
* [Zippered pouch](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packit-original-quick-trip/d/1333C2763?CategoryId=215) for holding dongles.
* [Elastic storage board](http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=61&product_id=156) for holding dongles.

I have not linked to dongles because of the combinatorial explosion of
possible connectors.
