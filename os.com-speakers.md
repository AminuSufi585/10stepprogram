* let speakers know whom to contact about a problem (speaker coordinator)
* Provided A/V, connectors
* Whether it'll be recorded and, if so, when/where it may be available & what the speakers' reposting rights are
* Provide a talk feedback/rating mechanism
    * plug it in keynotes
    * have it clearly linked on the website
    * tell speakers/room monitors about it and to plug it
    * ratings site/app should work under poor wifi conditions
    * should be just a star rating plus comments (comments required)
    * speakers should get to see anonymous feedback
